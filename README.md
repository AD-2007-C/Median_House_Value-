# Median_House_Value
This ML model tries to predict the median house value in a list of houses in California from an open dataset by sckit learn.
📌 Project Overview
Preprocessed the dataset (handled missing values, normalized features, etc.).
Built a Machine Learning model (e.g., Linear Regression / Decision Tree / Random Forest — adjust based on what you used).
Evaluated performance using metrics such as R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
